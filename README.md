Vote Chess

From 8:00 am to 11:55 am Students at Los Gatos High School will be able to go to the website and vote on which piece will move where.  

Afterward, the highest voted move will be executed and students at [unknown as of now] high School will be able to view the move and vote on what move they would like from 11:55 am to 2:35 pm.  

This continues every day until one school wins.
